# CrystalPrinter Tool

The CrystalPrinter Tool is a Python software tool developed to facilitate the conversion of crystal information files (.cif) into 3D printing-ready stereolithography files (.stl). The primary goal of this project is to provide a versatile and user-friendly solution for researchers and enthusiasts in the field of crystallography and materials science.

## Features:
- **CIF File Processing**: Ability to select and import locally saved .cif files, extracting atomic positions for further processing.
- **Unit Cell Drawing**: Capability to draw multiple unit cells, including fractional unit cells.
- **Lattice Plane Selection**: Choice of which lattice plane sits on the built plate, providing control over the printing orientation.
- **Selective Atomic Species**: Ability to select individual atomic species to be included in the print.
- **Bond Rendering**: Capability to draw bonds between neighboring atoms, considering nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and next-next-nearest-neighbor interactions.
- **Support Structure Integration**: Incorporation of supports required for successful 3D prints.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation explaining the code's functionality to enable further development and potential publication.
- **Magnetic Spin Visualization**: Ability to draw magnetic spins with user-defined directions.
- **Lattice Representation Options**: Choice between rendering the real lattice and the reciprocal lattice.
- **Flat Plane Drawing**: Capability of drawing flat planes representing real and reciprocal lattice planes.
- **Periodic Table UI**: User interface displaying a periodic table to highlight desired atomic species.
- **Parameter Setting UI**: General UI for choosing and setting parameters within the MVP.
- **Printability Analysis**: Implementation of an analysis tool to assess the printability of user-generated files.
